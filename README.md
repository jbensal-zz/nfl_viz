nfl_viz
=======

This is a vizualisation project by @mynameisraj and myself for the CS 199 Big Data Pilot course. We're working with NFL player data that we found at this link: https://github.com/abresler/asb_datasets . 

Must be run as a server. A simple Python way to do this is to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the directory, then navigate to localhost:8000
